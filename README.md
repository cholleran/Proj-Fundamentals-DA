Project Fundamentals of Data Analysis

Abstract:

This project examines the use of box plots and contrasts the height distribution of U.S. presidents with the heights of losing candidates who ran for president. It is interesting to examine these height distributions using box plots, while considering the notion that taller candidates may be more successful.


Contents:

Q1. Summarise the history of the box plot and situations in which it used
    - History and use of box plots

Q2 . Demonstrate the use of the box plot using data of your choosing.
  
- Height of U.S. presidents 
      Dataframe using data obtained from Wikipedia
- Box Plot of Height Distribution - U.S. Presidents
- Opponents' Heights - Height Distribution of Losing Candidates
- Side-by-side Plots of Presidential Candidate Distributions 
      Box plots of winning candidates' distribution 'data' next to losing candidates 'opp'.
      
Q3. Explain any relevant terminology such as the terms quartile and percentile.
     - Quartile:
        Ex.1
       
     - Percentile:
         Ex.1
         Ex.2

Q4. Compare the box plot to alternatives.
    -1. Box plots vs. Histograms
    -2. Box Plots vs. Violin Plots
    -3. Box Plots vs. Swarm Plots
    -4. Box Plots vs. Kernel Density Plots
